# cpp-single-linked-list

Implemented an analogue of the template class Single-linked list (forward_list) from the standard library. Data is stored in nodes created in dynamic memory (in the heap). Each node stores a value and a pointer to the next node in the list.

A custom forward_iterator type iterator is implemented for the list. Comparison operators, dereference operator * and access operator -> are implemented for iterators. The increment operator ++ is implemented.
